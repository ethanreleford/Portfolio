                    Hi, my name is Ethan Releford I am currently a college student studying for a bachelors degree in computer science and enjoy planning and designing websites. I started web design recently and have been improving my skills with every project I design. I am actively looking for an intership in web design as that is the field I enjoy and would like to expand my skills on!
